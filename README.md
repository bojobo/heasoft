# heasoft
A Dockerfile to create an image for [HEASOft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/). The Dockerfile is based on [NASA's Dockerfile](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/lheasoft/lheasoft6.34/Dockerfile_example).

Before building the image you have to download the source code from NASA's [website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/download.html), un-tar into the directory of the repository and adjust the version number in the Dockerfile if needed.
